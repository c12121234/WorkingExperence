## sliding window mechanism(滑動窗口/視窗機制)

功能：可靠傳輸以及流量控制

藉由處理send/recv windows來達成流量控制(**flow control**)、阻塞控制(**congestion control**)、可靠傳輸(**reliable data delivery**)


**sender**的byte有以下四種分類：
------------

**1.bytes sent and acknowlegded**

**2.bytes sent but not yet acknowleged**

**3.not sent but receiver is ready to recv it**

**4.byte not sent and receiver not ready to recv it**


**recv則有以下分類:**
-----

**1. recvd and acknowleged**

**2. not yet recvd,sender is permitted to send**

**3. not yet recvd,sender is not permitted to send**

-----

**send window size**:`total number of bytes which sender can send*(sent+not sent but ready to sent)`

**usable window size**:`total no of bytes which sender has not but ready to sent and can send at any time`

note:`if the recvr ever happen to recv bytes which falls outside the recv window,recvr will silently discard them`
